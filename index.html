								<h2>YMCA Launches Free Online Classes</h2>
								<p>
									CHICAGO, March 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Since its founding in 1844, the Y has been there to help communities through whatever challenge they were facing. Through the Great Depression, wars and natural disasters, the Y has been there. And while COVID-19, is a challenge unlike any other, the Y is still there, working to provide services and community, even as YMCAs throughout the country have had to temporarily close their doors. A new, online community program—YMCA 360—allows participants to stay connected and active, even when they can't visit the Y. The program will be accessible to both YMCA members as well as the general public for the foreseeable future.
									The free on-demand programs available on YMCA360.org include some of the Y's most popular group exercise classes like Boot Camp, Barre, Yoga and low impact programs for seniors. Each class is led by a YMCA instructor and reflects the same great programming people already expect from the Y – except these classes will be from the comfort of their own homes! The Y plans to release more exercise classes for adults as well as youth activities and classes throughout March and April. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ymca-launches-free-online-classes-301026515.html">Read more....</a>

								<h2>City of Memphis, YMCA to offer free childcare services to essential workers</h2>
								
								<a target="_blank" href="https://wreg.com/news/city-of-memphis-ymca-to-offer-free-childcare-services-to-essential-workers/"><img src="img/city_of_memphis.png" alt=""></a>
								<p>
									MEMPHIS, Tenn. – The City of Memphis is partnering with the YMCA to offer free childcare for children over five years old to essential workers at all community centers.
									They are starting with eight community centers and will then slowly phase in the others, offering free childcare at 23 community centers in all.The City of Memphis and the YMCA will start offering free childcare services at eight community centers before expanding the list.
									“As more businesses are opening back up and more are going back to work, I know many of you are concerned about childcare,” said Mayor Jim Strickland.
									Jerry Martin is the CEO and President of the YMCA of Memphis and the Mid-south. He says they already have been providing childcare programs and serving 700 kids.
									“We recognize that essential workers need childcare in a safe, supportive environment,” Martin said. “We put additional safety procedures under the guidance of the CDC and health department.”
									Martin says that includes health screenings and additional cleaning throughout the day. He says nine kids will be assigned to one counselor, and their group will not mingle with others.
									“In terms of health and safety, we will eliminate field trip programs and pool visits for the most part. It will look very different than our summer camp model has in the past,” Martin said.
									To qualify, parents must be a Tennessee resident and be considered an essential worker under the governor’s order. You can click this link to find out if you qualify for free childcare.
